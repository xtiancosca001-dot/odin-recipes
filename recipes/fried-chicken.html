            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a classic recipe for cooking the crispy fried
                chicken.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you
                    prefer.</li>
                <li>Place flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of
                    chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you
                    use). Season flour with paprika (which helps to brown the
                    chicken), salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time,
                    transfer them into the bag with flour; seal the bag and
                    shake to coat well.</li>
                <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and
                    cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL
                    THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS
                    CRUCIAL!</li>
                <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2
                    full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li>
                <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown
                    the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</li>
                <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30
                    minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy).
                    Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until
                    crispy.</li>
                <li>Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much
                    chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep
                    the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing
                    the rest.</li>
            </ol>
