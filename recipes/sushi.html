            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Sushi -- a Japanese delicacy that is both addicting and visually
                appealing.</p>
            <p>This is suitable for sushi lovers who want to make their first
                sushi at home.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bamboo rolling mat (makisu)</li>
                <li>Plastic wrap</li>
                <li>Sharp Knife</li>
                <li>Sushi Rice</li>
                <li>Seaweed Sheet (Nori)</li>
                <li>Cucumber (julienned)</li>
                <li>Carrots (julienned)</li>
                <li>Imitation Crab (kani)</li>
                <li>Wasabi</li>
                <li>Japanese Soy Sauce</li>
                <li>Daikon Radish</li>
                <li>Pickled Ginger</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the bamboo rolling mat (you can get an inexpensive one
                    online) on a cutting board so the bamboo strips are running
                    horizontally to you. Spread a strip of plastic wrap over the
                    bamboo mat. Then place a sheet (or a half sheet) of nori on
                    the plastic wrap.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori. (See below
                    for more about making perfect sushi rice.) Don't use too
                    much rice. With a little practice, you'll get a feel for how
                    much rice to use. We're spreading about 1 cup of rice per
                    whole sheet of nori, leaving a small space at the top edge
                    of the nori so you can seal up the roll.</li>
                <li>Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered
                    nori. Don't overpack it. If you're making a roll with the
                    rice on the outside, simply turn the nori over, placing it
                    rice-side down on the rolling mat. Then add your ingredients
                    to the top of the nori.</li>
                <li>Gently lift the bottom of the mat up and over the sushi.
                    Press and shape the ingredients into a tube. Roll with
                    pressure so you get a firm roll.</li>
                <li>Roll until just an inch of nori shows at the top. Seal the
                    edge of the nori with a little cold water. Firm it up by
                    squeezing the mat around the roll until it feels uniformly
                    snug. Be careful not to squeeze so hard that the ingredients
                    are smashed or come oozing out the sides. It's a fine line;
                    with practice you'll get the feel of it.</li>
                <li>Slice the sushi roll in half with a sharp knife on a cutting
                    board. Then cut each half into thirds -- so you have 6
                    pieces of sushi. To get a nice clean cut, wet the knife with
                    water each time you make a slice.</li>
                <li>Line the slices of sushi up on platters or sushi plates.
                    Enjoy with soy sauce, wasabi paste, and pickled ginger, and
                    a little chopped daikon if you like.</li>
