# odin-recipes
- Here is my first project in the Odin Project that applies all the 
things I learned and realized in HTML & CSS.
- Since I love food, I will be posting the recipes of my favorites.
- When I finish the project with some styling (using CSS), I would be
able to implement website from scratch and not encounter difficulties
in styling and picking the right color scheme and layouts. 
- I want to become a better developer not just on my job, but also
on my personal projects.
